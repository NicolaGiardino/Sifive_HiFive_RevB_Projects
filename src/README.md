# sifive-welcome
A simple welcome example which prints SiFive banner and uses board LEDs

The following files in the directory src/include:

    bits.h
        
    const.h
	
    encoding.h
        
    hifive1.h
        
    platform.h
        
    sections.h

and all the directory src/include/drivers have been forked from the repo cinco from WesternDigital.

They are now being used as a starting point for my version of the HAL.
